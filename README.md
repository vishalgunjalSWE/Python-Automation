## 💡 Projects Overview

### 1. 🏢 Org_Automation

Automation scripts designed to assist with common organizational tasks:

- **📝 Compare_list.py**: Compare two lists and perform operations like finding differences, common elements, etc.
- **🔗 Endpoint_Hit.py**: Sends requests to an API endpoint and retrieves a response.
- **🔗 Endpoint_hit2.py**: A variation of `Endpoint_Hit.py` for interacting with different APIs.
- **📜 List_with_sort.py**: Processes and sorts lists based on customizable criteria.

### 2. 🗣️ Python-Speech

Scripts that deal with speech processing in Python, such as converting speech to text or interacting with voice-based APIs.

- **🛠️ Under Development**: Detailed descriptions pending further exploration.

### 3. 🛠️ Python

General-purpose Python utilities that serve a variety of automation needs.

- **🛠️ Under Development**: Detailed descriptions pending further exploration.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get started with the repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishalgunjalSWE/Python-Automation.git
   cd python_automation-main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Each project might require specific packages. Use the following command to install any dependencies (if `requirements.txt` is available):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If not available, you may need to install packages manually like `requests` or speech libraries such as `speech_recognition`.

3. **Run the scripts**:
   Navigate to the relevant folder and execute the script:
   ```bash
   python Org_Automation/Compare_list.py
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Each script is designed for specific automation tasks. Before running a script, check its input/output requirements. You can customize the scripts for your own data or modify them to suit your needs.


Enjoy automating your tasks with Python! 😊
